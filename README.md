# RUSThello

This small project was begun as an exercise to learn some Rust programming language (<url>http://www.rust-lang.org</url>).

RUSThello features a basic shell interface. Human players and different kinds of AI are supported. Better AIs are currently under developement.

To install, download the source code and build using Cargo. Detailed instructions can be found at <url>https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/getting-started.html</url>.
